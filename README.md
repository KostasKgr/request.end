Advanced telemetry from any application with minimal effort!

The Request End Log Spec is a simple approach to obtain advanced telemetry from any application using just a single log line.

You may find this particularly useful for legacy applications that do not have open instrumentation libraries and for cases where you want insights but have no other telemetry infrastructure.


## Beta Version

This specification is currently in **beta**. Features and conventions are subject to change. We welcome feedback and contributions to help us reach a stable version.
